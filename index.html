            <h1>Archetypes</h1>
            <h2>History of Archetypes</h2>
            <p>The concept of the archetype is an old one. It has its origins dating back to Plato’s Forms/Ideas. It is Plato’s philosophy that behind our material world there are perfect Forms that transcend time and space. Forms are essentially a perfect representation of an object, such as a triangle, tree, or a mother. Over time, partially due to the scientific revolution, empiricism and nominalism became prevalent philosophies. Empiricism is a philosophy that states our knowledge is a posteriori, being deduced from our senses and experiences. Nominalism is a similar philosophy that maintains there are no abstract objects. The only objects that exist are spatiotemporal, which therefore reject Plato’s Forms. As a result of empiricism, knowledge was no longer viewed as a priori, which is knowledge that is innate and comes before our experiences. Due to the philosophical trends knowledge was then said to be a posteriori, which is derived from our experiences. Later, in the late 1700s, the philosopher Immanuel Kant published Critique of Pure Reason. Kant articulated that thought isn’t just pure reasoning or logic, it is also rooted in the person having the thought. He focused on the perception of the individual. These differences is perception color our objective reality. Previously philosophers asked, “Has this or that been seen, heard, handled, weighed, counted, thought, and found to be logical?” As a result of Kant’s work they asked, “Who saw, heard, or thought?” Kant’s view on personality affecting thoughts influenced Carl Jung’s work on archetypes. Carl Jung was a Swiss psychiatrist who popularised the concept of archetypes.</p>
            <h2>What Exactly are Archetypes?</h2>
            <p>Species have certain traits, instincts, and features which are traceable by their family line. There are human features and preconceived notions which prompt the human species to act human. According to Carl Jung, “We can only suppose that his behavior results from patterns of functioning” which are called images. Images are the form of activity taking place and the situation in which they are seen. Images are particular to a species, and would have to exist when the species originated. For humans, they are the activities and traits that transcend down and across generations. Individual functions, such as the important “creative fantasy”, are often derived from the unconscious predisposition. Plato’s influence can be seen in this specific application of the concept of the archetype.  Encyclopedia Brittanica explains what an archetype is best: "a primordial image, character, or pattern of circumstances that recurs throughout literature and thought consistently enough to be considered a universal concept or situation." Carl Jung's work on the archetype was a large influence on Joseph Campbell, an author, mythologist, professor, and proponent of these "elementary ideas." Campbell’s magnum opus, A Hero with A Thousand Faces, asserts there is a Monomyth, “a universal pattern that is the essence of, and common to, heroic tales in every culture.” His ideas influenced George Lucas in his work in creating the Star Wars series, which has been one of my favorite stories since I was a kid. So following this chain of events, without Plato, Kant, Jung, and Campbell we wouldn’t have the marvel that is Star Wars.</p>
            <h2>Archetypes and Their Applications</h2>
            <p>Adolf Bastian was an ethnologist who introduced many people to the concept of “elementary ideas.” He was also an influence on Carl Jung. Jung realized, archetypes are not only are passed down and across generations but can occur at a moment’s notice with no direct influence. This means there are ideas in the Platonic sense that live in the collective unconscious. The content of the archetypes are not passed down in the collective unconscious but only the forms and structures, which are empty. These forms and structures are waiting to be filled which makes for compelling storytelling. These ideas fleshed out by Jung have applications in psychiatry, his field of study, but transcend it as well. It is often applied in literature. Use of archetypal images in literature allows for compelling storytelling that permeates deep into our collective unconscious while still allowing the writer to tell their stories as they see fit. There are many types of archetypal images, and below are some examples. </p>

        <section id="examples">
            <h1>Examples</h1>
            <h2>The Child</h2>
            <p>Tracy K. Smith in her poem 4 ½, talks about her child in a way that represents the archetype of a child. The innocence of the child is reflected in her poetry. From avoiding the noisy cereal to hopping in place because she needs to pee, her daughter is the epitome of the child archetype. The portrayal of her daughter eloquently bottles some of the essence of the child archetype. It conjures the reader to think of their own or potential child, and their own childhood and parents. There are many other instances of the child motif throughout literature. One instance is the “child-god” archetype such as the Christ child.</p>
            <h2>The Trickster</h2>
            <p>Joy Harjo uses the archetype of a trickster in her poem, “Rabbit is Up to Tricks.” The trickster falls prey to his own desires and creates a selfish clay man that won’t listen to it’s creator. I was familiar with the trickster archetype but unaware that rabbits sometimes represent it. According to Scientific American’s “The Legacy of the Trickster Hare”, the rabbit was often shown as a trickster figure in Native American and African folklore. When researching this archetype I found the story of Br’er Rabbit and the Tar Baby. According to encyclopedia.com, Br’er Fox creates a baby made out of tar. When Br’er Rabbit tries to speak to the Tar Baby, he doesn’t get a reply. This causes Br’er Rabbit to get stuck in the trap of the figure. There are quite a few direct parallels between this story and Joy Harjo’s poem. They both contain the rabbit trickster archetype and both rabbits get caught in anthropomorphic animal-made creatures, albeit one literally and one metaphorically.</p>
            <h2>The Mother</h2>
            <p>Tarfia Faizullah in her poem, Mother, uses the mother archetype in addition to the child. The image of an innocent child points out where a child is most free: in their mother’s arms. The warmth of the mother’s embrace where the child feels the safest, and can therefore do anything to their heart’s desire. There are many types of subcategories of archetypes. There are many different and fluid ways to classify them. In regards to the mother archetype, the mother can be seen as the Great Mother in some instances, someone who can bring about creation or destruction. As stated earlier, archetypes don’t have to be of people themselves but can be of an attitude, situation, or person. One archetype of an attitude that is well known is the mother complex.</p>
